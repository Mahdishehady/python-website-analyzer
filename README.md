# News Scraper 
A Python project that scrapes news data from a website using BeautifulSoup and inserts it into a MongoDB database.

# Description
This project is designed to scrape news data from a specific website using Python and the BeautifulSoup library.
The primary purpose is to extract essential information such as article headlines, timestamps, and article content from the scraped news articles.
The extracted data is then stored in a MongoDB database, which allows for easy storage, retrieval, and analysis of the news content.

In addition to scraping and storing data, your project also involves a feature for visualizing the collected data using Highcharts. 
Instead of directly scraping data from the website, your updated approach involves retrieving data from the backend using an API.
Once the data is fetched, it is visualized using Highcharts, a JavaScript charting library, which can create interactive and visually appealing charts.

# Features
* Web scraping using BeautifulSoup.
* Storing scraped data in a MongoDB database.
* Easily configurable to scrape from different news websites.
* Visualization with Highcharts: The collected data is fetched from the backend via an API and then visualized using Highcharts, allowing for interactive and informative charts to be displayed.


# Technologies Used
1. Python: The primary programming language used for building the project and handling various data processing tasks.
2. BeautifulSoup: A Python library for web scraping, used to parse HTML and XML documents and extract data from them.
3. MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing the scraped news data in a structured manner.
4 .Highcharts: A JavaScript charting library that facilitates the creation of interactive and visually appealing charts for data visualization.
